# Puppeteer Demos

This repository contains various demos of concepts, ideas and experiments with puppeteer that were demonstrated during the talk I did for Know IT. All credits go to my friend Önder Ceylanare for developing the original presentation and demos.


The scripts in this repository are built for training and demonstration purposes only, feel free to use them at your own risk.

## How to run scripts?

Install dependencies
```
npm i
```

Execute scripts with
```
node fps.js
```

Run tests with
```
npx jest dom-snapshot.spec.js
```
